       REACT (Front End Technology)
---------------------------------------------
   Basic Commands
----------------------------
1. to create react app : npx create-react-app project-name
2. to run react app : npm start
3. to install axios: npm i axios
4. to install react-router-dom: npm i react-router-dom
5. to install react bootstrap: npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
        - Import bootstrap theme from https://bootswatch.com/ (bootstrap.min.css) to index.js file

Features and Concepts
---------------------
1. Used to build UI with the help of JS libraries.
2. Used to built single page applications.
3. Declarative : 
4. Immutable & Mutable
5. Pure functions : It wont cause side effects.
6. Virtual DOM
7. Unidirectional Data Flow : parent to child
8. JSX - (Javascript XML) 
       - Every jsx expression should be placed in a single tag
       - React fragments : <> </>
       - Instead of attribute class use className
       - Instead of attribute for use htmlFor
       - to display js expression in jsx place js expression inside a  {}
       - every tag must  have its closing tag,
       - tag without content - self closing tag
9. Transpiling : converting JSX to (HTML,CSS,JS) - babel Library
10. to create react app - create-react-app command
11. React App consist of one or more components : A tree structure of components with starting component - App component
12. Component : Is a small part of UI,return HTML
    - is js file with filename starting with a capital letter
    - Different components in react
        - Functional/stateless components
        - Class based/stateful components
13. Props : used to share data from parent to child
    - its an object
    - child component can access shared data via  props from its argument
14. Styling Component using CSS
    - inline CSS
    - external styling sheet
    - CSS module: a file with extension as .module.css
15. React Events Handling
    - without argument : event bind using its function name only
    - with argument : event bind using arrow function
    - with even object : event bind using arrow function with event object
16. Conditional Rendering
    - if statements : && operator
    - if-else statements : Ternary ?: operator
17. React State: 
    - predefined object to store property of a class based component
    - when state changes then component re-Render
    - to change value of state - use setState(value)
18. React Component Lifecycle
    - Mounting phase : putting all elements into DOM
          - constructor()
          - getDerivedStateFromProps()
          - render()
          - componentDidMount()
    - Updating phase : while updating component
          - getDerivedStateFromProps()
          - shouldComponentUpdate()
          - render()
          - getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
          - componentDidUpdate()
    - Unmounting phase : Removing component from DOM
          - componentWillUnmount()
19. React Hooks : provide react features like state and Lifecycle etc to Functional Component
    - Import hook from react to Functional component by calling hook
    - Hook can only called at top level of component
    - Hook cannot be Conditional
    - Types of Hooks
        - Predefined Hooks
           - useState(initial-value) : return state and function to updating state
           - useEffect(<function>,<dependancy>) : Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components
             - useEffect runs on every render
             - Based on dependancy we can control side effect
                 - No dependancy passed: Runs on every render
                 - An empty array: Runs only on the first render
                 - Props or state value: Runs on the first render, and any time any dependancy valye changes
           - useNavigate() : used to redirect from one page to another, return a method for changing the location
        - Custom Hooks
20. Rendering List (Array of List) : use map method
21. React Forms : handled by component
        - preventDefault() : method to cancel the event if its possible
        - Types of component
            - Controlled components : managed by react component
            - Uncontrolled components : managed by DOM
22. API Call - React
    - Using Axios Library: Promise based HTTP client for the browser and node.js
    - Creating an instance: using create method in Axios
23. Routing / set up path for componentin React
    - Use react-router-dom Library
        - entire app should be inside BrowserRouter
        - wrap all components which needed to be set up path inside Routes
        - to set up path for component use Route
    - Link : used to redirect from one page to another
     useNavigate Hook : redirection
